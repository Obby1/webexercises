<li>HTTP is a protocol for transfering data securely across different devices. It stands for hyper text transfer protocol
</li>
<li>URL is text the specifies the hostname which will be used to retrieve data
</li>
<li>DNS (domain name system) converts the hostname into a server IP address, which is 4 numbers separated with a .
</li>
<li>A query string typically starts with a q or query and specifies some sort of data to search for. It is a series
    of key value pairs. 
</li>
<li>Get and Set are the two most common http verbs. Get retrieves data from a server to be displayed and can be
    accompanied by a query string. Set will manipulate some data on the server.
    </li>
<li>An HTTP request is sent from a client asking for information from a server. Typically in the form of a URL,
    the request is sent by one computer to retreive data from a specific server. 
    </li>
<li>An HTTP response is the answer of a server to the HTTP requesting client. It is separated by different headers such as 
    Accept-Language which specifies the language the HTTP request wants to view the information in. 
    </li>
<li>When you type a URL into a browser, the browser will attempt to send an HTTP request to the hostname and port based
    on the URL. The data is typically transmitted through a series of routers until finally landing on the correct
    hostname as specified by the URL. The HTTP requests including headers are responded to and eventually packaged by the requestors
    browser into a DOM from the HTML. Additional resources are also requested to complete the request.
    If the server does not have the requested information an error code
    is returned typically a 404 or 4xx error stating the reason. A separate request is made for each resource.
